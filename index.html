    <p>
        Just a ordinary guy from Cairo, Georgia doing extraordinary things. Football was my life from age 5 to age 24.
        I can't not express enough gratitude towards the sport that evolved me into the person I am today. I've battled
        hardships, from tearing my ACL in college to being diagnosed with sleep apnea. However, I wake up every day ready
        to battle whatever obstacles that may arise. 

        On a lighter note, I enjoy weightlifting, creating graphic desgins, and playing video games (Xbox). If you would
        like to add me as a friend on Xbox, my gamer tag is DeuceLafetti. Anyways, I received my undergraduate degree in 
        Computer Science at the University of the South and earned a MBA from Berry College. Currently, I work at Chick-fil-A
        Inc. as an IT Analyst.  With much interest in automation, I am looking to learn as much as I can to better serve
        the industry. Feel free to roam around and check out my portfolio!
